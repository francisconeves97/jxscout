# jxscout

**jxscout** is a tool designed to help security researchers analyze and find vulnerabilities in JavaScript code. It works with your favorite proxy (Burp or Caido), capturing requests and saving optimized versions locally for easy analysis in your preferred code editor.

> Work in Progress üèóÔ∏è jxscout is currently under active development. As it continues to be improved and features expanded, there may be breaking changes in future updates.

## Key Features

- **Asset Organization**: Automatically saves and organizes relevant static assets (HTML, JavaScript) into an intuitive folder structure.
- **Chunks Pre-Fetching**: Detects and pre-fetches Webpack and Vite chunks for comprehensive analysis.
- **Code Beautification**: Automatically beautifies JavaScript files, making them easier to read and analyze.
- **Source Map Discovery**: Automatically reverses application source code if .map files are available.
- **AST Analysis**: Automatically analyzes JavaScript files finding interesting functionality for vulnerability researchers. See [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-vscode) to learn how to install the extension.

## Installation & Instructions

### Requirements

- **golang**: https://go.dev/doc/install - jxscout is written in golang
- **bun** (>=1.2.12 recommended): https://bun.sh/docs/installation - used for the chunk discovery script

### Part 1. Installing the CLI

The first step to get up and running with jxscout is to install the CLI. To do that, just run the command below or download a pre-compiled binary from the [release page](https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/releases).

```
go install github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/cmd/jxscout@latest
```

![jxscout](docs/jxscout.png)

The jxscout CLI has a prompt with many commands, one of them is `install` which installs `bun` and `prettier`, which are needed dependencies of jxscout. If you don't have those tools installed, feel free to install them manually or by running the `install` command.

### Part 2. Proxy Setup

jxscout will only start capturing assets after you setup your proxy to forward requests to it. To do that, you should install the right plugin for your proxy:

- For Caido users: Check out https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-caido
- For Burp users: Check out https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-burp

After you install the proxy plugin, every asset that flows through your proxy should be automatically saved to your `~/jxscout` folder.

One useful feature is the ability to organize your assets in projects (similar to how you would do in your proxy). To do this, you can run `config project-name=my_project` in the jxscout CLI, and from that moment on, assets will be saved in `~/jxscout/my_project`.

If you don't see assets being saved at this point, you should check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Part 3. VSCode Extension

The VSCode extension is a frontend for jxscout. It allows you to visualize the AST Analysis results of jxscout in a useful tree. It also allows you to copy values from there, including paths and query params for bruteforcing.

To get started with the VSCode Extension head over to https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-vscode for more instructions.

You can check the structure of the analysis tree on [docs/tree.md](./docs/tree.md) to get a picture of what descriptors you will get.

## Troubleshooting

This section should help you troubleshoot problems with jxscout.

### Some files are not being downloaded

jxscout will only save assets that go through your proxy. This means that if the browser is caching some of those assets, jxscout will have no visibility of them. Because of this, it's important to disable your browser's cache when using jxscout.

If you still don't see some assets, they could be out of scope and filtered, or it could be a bug.

### View logs

jxscout provides a log view, which you can access by typing `l` in the CLI prompt. However, you can also access the log file directly by opening `~/.jxscout/jxscout.log`.

You can turn on debug logging by using `config debug=true`, which will give you more verbose output from jxscout.

### If you don't see any relevant logs

Your proxy plugin might not be feeding requests into jxscout. Check your jxscout proxy plugin settings and verify that:

- It is enabled and working
- The configured hostname/port matches where jxscout is running
- You are trying to access an in-scope website if the "Filter requests in-scope" option is enabled on the proxy plugin

### Understanding jxscout internals

jxscout uses SQLite and bundles some JS scripts that are run by bun. All of these files will be extracted to your `~/.jxscout/` directory.

### Opening up a github issue

If you couldn't figure out the issue or if you found a bug, feel free to open an issue as I am always happy to help!

## Usage

```bash
jxscout
```

Once jxscout is running, you can:

- Run the `guide` command for a quick walkthrough
- Run the `help` command for an overview of the available commands
- Watch the video tutorial for a visual guide on configuring and using jxscout

### Available Commands

These are the commands available on the `jxscout` prompt. You can run `help` to get this list.

```
Available commands:

assets (la) - List assets for the current project with pagination and search
  Usage: assets [page=<page_number>] [page-size=<page_size>] [search=<search_term>]

caido-auth (ca) - Authenticate with Caido to use overrides (token is stored in memory and will reset on server restart)
  Usage: caido-auth

clear (c) - Clears the output
  Usage: clear

config (cf) - View or update jxscout configuration options
  Usage: config [options] | Use 'config' without arguments to view current configuration
