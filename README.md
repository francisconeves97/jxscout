# jxscout

**jxscout** is a tool designed to help security researchers analyze and find vulnerabilities in JavaScript code. It works with your favorite proxy (Burp or Caido), capturing requests and saving optimized versions locally for easy analysis in your preferred code editor.

> Work in Progress üèóÔ∏è jxscout is currently under active development. As it continues to be improved and features expanded there may be breaking changes in future updates.

## Key Features

- **Asset Organization**: Automatically saves and organizes relevant static assets (HTML, JavaScript) into an intuitive folder structure.
- **Chunks Pre-Fetching**: Detects and pre-fetches Webpack and Vite chunks for comprehensive analysis.
- **Code Beautification**: Automatically beautifies JavaScript files, making them easier to read and analyze.
- **Source Map Discovery**: Automatically reverses application source code if .map files are available.

## Requirements

- **golang**: https://go.dev/doc/install - jxscout is written in golang
- **bun**: https://bun.sh/docs/installation - used for the chunk discovery script

## Installation & Setup

To install, just run the below command or download pre-compiled binary from [release page](https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/releases).

```
go install github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/cmd/jxscout@latest
```

You can then run the `install` command to get all the necessary dependencies (bun, prettier and reverse-sourcemap)

### Proxy Setup

To get started with jxscout, you'll need to set up a proxy to forward requests to it. Here's how:

- For Caido users: Check out https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-caido for installation instructions
- For Burp users: Head over to https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-burp for setup details

## Usage

```bash
jxscout
```

Once jxscout is running, you can:
- Run the `guide` command for a quick walkthrough
- Watch the video tutorial for a visual guide on configuring and using jxscout

### Demo

### Available Commands

```
Available commands:

assets (la) - List assets for the current project with pagination and search

  Usage: caido-auth

clear (c) - Clears the output
  Usage: clear

config (cf) - View or update jxscout configuration options
  Usage: config [options] | Use 'config' without arguments to view current configuration

config-reset (cfr) - Reset all configuration options to default values
  Usage: config-reset

exit (q) - Exits the application
  Usage: exit

guide (g) - Show a guide on how to use jxscout
  Usage: guide

help (h) - Shows help information for commands
  Usage: help [command]

install (i) - Install jxscout dependencies (npm, bun, prettier, reverse-sourcemap)
  Usage: install

loaded (ldd) - Show assets that loaded a specific JavaScript asset
  Usage: loaded <asset_url> [page=<page_number>] [page-size=<page_size>]

loads (lds) - Show JavaScript assets loaded by a specific HTML page
  Usage: loads <html_url> [page=<page_number>] [page-size=<page_size>]

logs (l) - Toggle logs panel
  Usage: logs

override (o) - Toggle local override for a specific URL (only available for Caido). 
This will override the content of an asset when you visit it in your browser.
When overriding an HTML file keep the (index).html suffix.
The `assets` command will give you the right URL to use.
  Usage: override <url>

overrides (lo) - List overrides
  Usage: overrides [page=<page_number>] [page-size=<page_size>]

truncate-tables (tt) - Delete all data tracked in jxscout database (requires confirmation)
  Usage: truncate-tables

version (v) - Show the current version and checks for updates
  Usage: version
```

4. Setup your proxy to ingest requests into jxscout



### Chunk Discovery Script

The chunk discovery script is written in TypeScript and can be used standalone outside of jxscout. You can use any JS runtime to run it (jxscout uses bun).

You can check the script here: https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/blob/main/pkg/chunk-discoverer/index.ts

The script expects two args:

- The path to the JS file to analyze for webpack chunks
- A bruteforce limit, used when the Webpack chunk loading function can create an unlimited number of valid chunk names.

Example:

```
bun run pkg/chunk-discoverer/index.ts /path/to/the/js/file 10
```
