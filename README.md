# jxscout

**jxscout** is a tool designed to help security researchers analyze and find vulnerabilities in JavaScript code. It works with your favorite proxy (Burp or Caido), capturing requests and saving optimized versions locally for easy analysis in your preferred code editor.

> Work in Progress üèóÔ∏è jxscout is currently under active development. As it continues to be improved and features expanded there may be breaking changes in future updates.

## Key Features

- **Asset Organization**: Automatically saves and organizes relevant static assets (HTML, JavaScript) into an intuitive folder structure.
- **Chunks Pre-Fetching**: Detects and pre-fetches Webpack and Vite chunks for comprehensive analysis.
- **Code Beautification**: Automatically beautifies JavaScript files, making them easier to read and analyze.
- **Source Map Discovery**: Automatically reverses application source code if .map files are available.
- **AST Analysis**: Automatically analyzes JavaScript files finding interesting functionality for vulnerability researchers. See [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-vscode) to learn how to install the extension.

## Requirements

- **golang**: https://go.dev/doc/install - jxscout is written in golang
- **bun**: https://bun.sh/docs/installation - used for the chunk discovery script

## Installation & Instructions

### Part 1. Installing the CLI

The first step to get up and running with jxscout is to install the CLI. To that, just run the below command or download pre-compiled binary from [release page](https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/releases).

```
go install github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/cmd/jxscout@latest
```

![jxscout](docs/jxscout.png)

The jxscout CLI has a prompt with many commands, one of them is `install` which installs `bun` and `prettier`, which are needed dependencies of jxscout. If you don't have those tools installed, feel free to install them manually or by running the `install` command.

### Part 2. Proxy Setup

jxscout will only start capturing assets after you setup your proxy to forward requests to it. To do that, you should install the right plugin for your proxy:

- For Caido users: Check out https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-caido
- For Burp users: Check out https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout-burp

After you installed the proxy plugin, every asset that flows through your proxy should be automatically saved to your `~/jxscout` folder.

One useful thing to do is to organize your assets in projects (like you would do on your proxy). To do that you can run `config project-name=my_project` on jxscout CLI and from that moment on assets will be saved in `~/jxscout/my_project`,

If you don't see assets being saved at this point, you should check the Troubleshooting section.

### Part 3. (Optional) VSCode Extension

The VSCode extension is a frontend for jxscout. It allows you to visualize the AST Analysis results of jxscout in a useful tree. It also allows you to copy values from there, including paths and query params for bruteforcing.

## Building locally

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout.git
cd jxscout
```

2. Install dependencies and build the project

```bash
make install
make build
```

3. Run the server

- Using the binary

```bash
./dist/jxscout
```

- Or directly with Go

```bash
go run cmd/jxscout/main.go
```

4. Setup your proxy to ingest requests into jxscout

### Chunk Discovery Script

The chunk discovery script is written in TypeScript and can be used standalone outside of jxscout. You can use any JS runtime to run it (jxscout uses bun).

You can check the script here: https://github.com/francisconeves97/jxscout/blob/main/pkg/chunk-discoverer/index.ts

The script expects two args:

- The path to the JS file to analyze for webpack chunks
- A bruteforce limit, used when the Webpack chunk loading function can create an unlimited number of valid chunk names.

Example:

```
bun run pkg/chunk-discoverer/index.ts /path/to/the/js/file 10
```
